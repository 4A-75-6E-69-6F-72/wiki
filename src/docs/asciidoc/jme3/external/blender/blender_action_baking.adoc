There are many 3D model <<jme3/features.html#supported-external-file-types#,Supported External File Types>> for jMonkeyEngine. Some of them bake your actions automatically on export, others don't. Baking is a destructive process so it is recommended that you test the animation in-game first. If your animations are all messed up, try baking them or use a different exporter.

If you find yourself in need of baking, the process is as follows.

.  From the Blender `Info` header, select `menu:File[Save Copy]`.
.  Save the file somewhere other than the current folder. This will save you the effort of re-creating the animation file if you need it at some other time.
.  In the `Info` header, change the `Default` screen layout to `Animation`.
.  In the `Dope Sheet Editor`, change the `Dope Sheet` mode/context to `Action Editor`.
.  Click the btn:[Action to be linked] button and select your action.
.  In the `3d Viewport` header, select the armature.
*  Depending on the mode selected choose:
.. Object Mode: `menu:Object[Animation > Bake Action]`.
.. Pose Mode: `menu:Pose[Animation > Bake Action]`.
.  In the `Bake Action` dialog, deselect and set the settings as follows:
Bake Action::
- [ ] Selected Only
- [x] Visual Keying
- [x] Clear Constraints
- [ ] Clear Parents
- [ ] Overwrite Current
-Â  Bake Data = Pose
.  When ready click btn:[OK].
.  The `Linked Action` in the `Dope Sheet Editor` will change to the newly baked action and is named `Action`. Rename this to the name of the imported animation.
.  Select the btn:[F] button to save the action.
.  Save your file.
.  Clear the old action from the `Linked Action` buffer. See <<blender/blender_buffer_clearing#,Blender Buffer Clearing>> for more information.
